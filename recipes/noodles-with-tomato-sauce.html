    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> A symbolic dish of Italian cuisine, with the typical ingredients of the Bel Paese: spaghetti, tomato and basil. Spaghetti with tomato sauce is an institution, a simple but far from trivial recipe. It is subject to infinite variations to find the perfect balance of flavors, the right creaminess and sweetness, starting from the choice of the type of tomato. This classic first course is a real test for those who love to prepare it at home, but also for star chefs who jealously guard the secrets of their perfect versions! Here we are at the stove with you to suggest our recipe of this timeless classic: peeled tomatoes cooking slowly over low heat and the scent of fresh basil leaves are the key ingredients to successful results! You may remember the famous scene from the movie "Miseria e Nobilta", when Felice Sciosciammocca and the other members of the family swoop down on the serving plate and start grabbing spaghetti with tomato sauce with their hands... well, we are sure that with our version you will be tempted to do the same! Enjoy your meal!
